- 👋 Hi, I’m @patriciayoung, but I go by Trish. I have been working more in the science fields but am looking to make a career change into data analysis. 
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and analytics, if there is a science component to that even better.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and combining my coding skills with Tableau.
- 💞️ I’m looking to keep my coding skills fresh while adding new visualization skills to aid in an analystics setting.
